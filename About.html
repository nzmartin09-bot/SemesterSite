			So a little about me, my name is Nathan Martin, and I am or was 16 years old when i 
			started this website, I am currently learning web development and programming as a whole,
			and I hope to one day make a career out of it. If thats where life takes me. Now 
			enough about me, lets get into the how I made this website. (not all of it that would take way 
			to long:) <br> 
			disclaimer: I did use google and other websites to help with some of the code, but I
			typed out all of it myself and learned a lot in the process)  
		</p>

	<div id="C1">
		<p> 
			I made this website using Visual Studio Code, a code editor that is free to download
			and use. I used HTML and CSS to make the website, HTML is the structure of the website
			and CSS is what makes it look good. I learned a lot about both of these languages while
			making this website, and I am still learning more every day. I also used a lot of trial and error to figure out how to do things, which was
			sometimes frustrating but also very rewarding when I finally got something to work. <br>
			( or just flat our gave up and left that part out) 
		</p>

		<p>
			So first how does html work? It is a programing launage designed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, and it is used to create websites.
			Now as I mentioned before css is also another language used to make websites look good, it was created in 1996 by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.
			without this website would look very plain and boring, and would have no flow form or whatever. <br>
			So firstly some of the code I used from google and other sites. <br> <br>
			#1. Display: This is used to change how elements are displayed on the page, such asinline or flex. <br>
			<img id="img1" src="../PagePhotos/display.png" alt="display code example" width="100%"> <br><br>

			#2. Border-radius: This is used to create rounded corners on elements, such as buttons or images. <br>
			<img id="img2" src="../PagePhotos/border-radius.png" alt="border-radius code example" width="100%"> <br><br>

			#3. Button: This is used to create clickable buttons on the page, which can be linked to other pages. <br>
			<img id="img3" src="../PagePhotos/button.png" alt="button code example" width="100%"> <br><br>

			These are just a few examples of the code I used to make this website, but there is a lot more to it than that. These are the onse I found using google... 
			I hope you like my website!
