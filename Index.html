		You like totally don't know me, but its cool. I was orignally going
		to make a website about grafics cards, but then I was like
		"Hey! Why not make it about me!" So here we are. Enjoy! <br>
		 -ps I also didn't feel like doing research on grafics cards.
		 </p>

		 <p>So feel free to look around, I mean like why else are you here you obviously
		 were told to look at it by my or one of my friends or something. So yeah, 
		 enjoy the site and all that jazz and if you feel like it I would love feedback.
